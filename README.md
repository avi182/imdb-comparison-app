## IMDB-Comparison-App

This app contains 2 sub-modules, a back-end app (NestJS + TypeScript) & front-end app (React Hooks + Recharts + Material UI).

The back-end is using Puppeteer in order to scrape IMDB movie pages (by thier URL) and returns a normalized "Movie" object to it's consumers.

The front-end app contains many comparison charts in order to analyze the correlation between different parameters in those movies.

(yarn was used during the development)
